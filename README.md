This is the most common task in any corp system (grab data from my xls, do some magic and give me back my data to my xls) 
and instead of building another boilerplate spacecraft that has some functionality using diferrent libs and styles 
for diferrent types of files (xls, xlsd, xlsx, any other), just you can use this lib and develop some extra features 
for free, for common happyness of our lazy bored god of software. DRY KISS is what we like.

Lib is currently under development so you are welcome on board.

Right now it supports XLS and XLSX. No support for MAC "*.numbers" format.
Also I am not sure about others.
